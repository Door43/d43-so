Later that day, two of Jesus’ followers were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they talked about the death of Jesus and how the women said he was alive again. They wondered if Jesus really was the Messiah.


Maalinta ka bacdi, laba kamid ah xertii Ciise ayaa waxa aay ku sii socdeen  magalo u dhow. Intii aay sii socdeen waxa aay ka hadlayeen dhimashadii Ciise iyo sida aay dumarkii u yidhahdeen wuu nool yahay mar labaad. Waxay aad ula yaabanayeen inu runtii Ciise aha Masiix.

Jesus came up and started walking with them, but they did not recognize him. He asked what they were talking about, and they told him about all the terrible things that had happened during the last few days. They thought he was a stranger who had not heard about it.


Ciise ayaa ku soo baxay markasu la sii socday iyaaga laakiin isaga may aqoonsan. Waxa uu weydiyeey iyagu waxa aay ka sheekaysanayeen, kadib waxa aay uga sheekeyn dhacadii Ciise ku dhacday ayaamo ka hor. Waxa aay u malaynayeen inu yahay nin qariiba oo aan war u hayn waxa dhacay.

Then Jesus explained to them what God’s Word says about the Messiah. He reminded them that the prophets said the Messiah would suffer and be killed, but would rise again on the third day. When they arrived at the town where they were going, it was almost night.


Kadib Ciise ayaa u macneyeey iyagii sida aay ugu qoran tahay kitaabka Ilaahay in Masiix noqon doono. Waxa uu iyaga xasuusiyeey sida aay nebiyashii hore loo sii sheegay in Masiix uu dhibaaton doono lana dili doono laakiin u maalinta saddex uu so kici doono. Markii aay magalada yimaadeen  messhi aay ku socdeen waxa aay gadhay habeenimo.

The two men invited Jesus to stay with them, so he did. Before they ate, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked God for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that he was Jesus. At that moment, he disappeared.


Labadii nin ayaa Ciise macsuumay inu iyaga cawa la joogo, kadib wuu la joogay. Ka hor intii anay waxba cunin, Ciise waxa uu soo saray in yar oo rooti ah, waanu u duceyey, waanu kala jebiyeey. Kadib isla markiiba waxa aay aqoonsadeen inu Ciise yahay. Isla markiba Ciise waa la wayeey.

The two men said to each other, “Our hearts were burning when he explained God’s Word to us!” Immediately, they went back to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they told the disciples, “Jesus is alive! We have seen him!”


Labadii nin ayaa isku yidhi, “ Qalbiyadeenu wey holcayeen markii uu ereyga Ilaahay inoo sharaxayeey!” Isla markiiba, waxa aay ku laabteen Yeruuslaam. Marka aay yimadeen, waxa aay xertii u sheegeen, “ Inu Ciise nool yahay! oo aay arkeen isaga!”

Suddenly, Jesus appeared! The disciples thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, “Peace to you! Why are you afraid and doubting? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” To show he was not a ghost, he asked for a piece of cooked fish and ate it.


Isla markaasna Ciise ayaa u muuqday! Xertii waxa aay mooden inu yahay jin, laakiin Ciise ayaa ku yidhi, “ Nabadi ha idin kor ahato! maxaad la cabsanaysa ee aad la shakisan tihiin? eega gacamahayga iyo lugahayga. jinku ma waxa uu leeyahay sida jidhkayga oo kale.”  sii uu u shaki saro iyaga waxa uu  weydistay in yar oo kaluuna waanu cunay.

“I told you that everything written about me in God’s Word must be fulfilled,” Jesus said. Then he opened their minds so they could understand God’s Word. He said, “It was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day.”


“Waxa kaste oo aniga ereyga Ilaahay laygu qoray waa in la fuliyaa.” Ciise ayaa sida yidhi. Kadib masaxdooda ayuu furay si aay y fahmaan waxa eryega Ilaahay ku qoran. Waxa uu ku yidhi, “ Mar hore ayaa la qoray in Masiixa uu dhibatoon doono, dhiman doono, kadibna maalinta saddexad uu dhimashada ka soo kici doona.”

“It was also written that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed to all people groups, starting in Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.”


“Waxa kale oo la qoray in toobadd cafiiska denbilaaya aad ku dhawaqdaan dadka kala duwan oo dhan oo aay ugu horeyso Yeruuslaam.  Markhaatii ayaad ka noqon doontan waxaas oo dhan.”

During the next forty days, Jesus appeared to his disciples and followers many times. Once, he even appeared to more than 500 people at the same time! He proved to his disciples in many ways that he was alive, and he taught them about the Kingdom of God.


Intii lagu jiray afartan cisho Ciise wuu u muqanayeey xertiisa iyo kuwa raacay wakhtiyo badan. Mar, ayaa waxa uu u muqday dad kabadan 500 oo qof isla mar qudha! Xertiisa waxa uu u cadeyey marar fara badan inu isagu nool yahay, waxanu baray boqortoyadda Ilaahay.

At the end of the forty days, Jesus said to his disciples, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. So go, make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and by teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”


Marka aay afartankii cisho dhamaadeen, Ciise waxa uu xertiisa ku yidhi, “ Awooda samada iyo dhulka aniga ayaa la siyeey. Orda oo  dadka xerta Ciise ka dhiga idinka oo ku biya gelinayaa magic Aabbaha, Wiilka iyo Ruuxa Quduuska idinka oo baraaya iyaga wax kaste oo aan idinku amray.”

“Remember, I will be with you always. Stay in Jerusalem until you receive power from above.” Then Jesus was taken up to heaven, and a cloud hid him from their sight. Jesus sat down at the right hand of God to rule over all things.


“Xasuusta, Inaan mar kaste idin la joogo. Jooga Yeruuslaam ilaa aad awood xaga sare ka heshaan.” Kadib Ciise Jannada ayaa loo qaaday, isaga oo aay daruuruhu aragiisa ka sii qarinayaan xertiisi. Ciise waxa uu fadhiya gacanta midi ee Ilaahay isaga oo loo igmaday inu wax kaste xukumo.
