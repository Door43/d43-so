One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with him. (This John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves.


Lix maalmood dabadeed Ciise wuxuu waday Butros iyo Yacquub iyo walaalkiis Yooxanaa, oo wuxuu keligood geeyey buur dheer.

All of a sudden, Jesus’ face became as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.


Hortoodana ayuu ku beddelmay, wejigiisuna sida qorraxda oo kale ayuu u dhalaalay, dharkiisuna sida nuurka oo kale ayuu u caddaaday.

Then Moses and Elijah, who had both lived hundreds of years earlier, appeared. They talked with Jesus about his death which would soon happen in Jerusalem.


Oo bal eeg, waxaa iyaga u muuqday Muuse iyo Eliyaas oo la hadlaya isaga.

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said, “Jesus, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter did not know what he was saying.


Markaasaa Butros u jawaabay oo wuxuu Ciise ku yidhi, Sayidow, waxaa inoo wanaagsan inaynu halkan joogno. Haddaad doonayso saddex waab ayaan halkan ka dhisayaa, mid adaan kuu dhisayaa, midna Muuse, midna Eliyaas.

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down on top of them and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him.” The three disciples were terrified and fell on the ground.


Intuu weli hadlayay, daruur dhalaalaysa ayaa hadhaysay, oo cod baa daruurtii ka soo baxay oo yidhi, Kanu waa Wiilkayga aan jeclahay oo aan ku faraxsanahay. Maqla isaga.

Then Jesus touched them and said, “Do not be afraid. Get up.” When they looked around they saw no one but Jesus.


Xertiina goortay maqleen, ayay wejigooda u dhaceen, aad bayna u baqeen.  Markaasaa Ciise u yimid oo taabtay oo ku yidhi, Kaca, hana baqina.

As Jesus and the three disciples went back down the mountain, Jesus said to them, “Do not tell anyone about what happened here until after I have been raised from the dead.”


Markay buurta ka soo degayeen, Ciise ayaa amray oo wuxuu ku yidhi, Ninna ha u sheegina wixii aad aragteen intaanu Wiilka Aadanahu kuwii dhintay ka soo sara kicin.
