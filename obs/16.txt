After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God’s laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of Yahweh, the true God. The Israelites had no king to lead them, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.


Marku Yashuuca dhintay, ayeey Israa’iiliyintii Ilaah casiyeen oo aay diideen inay amarkiisa raacan xaqna ku dhacmaan, oo waxa kale oo aay diideen inay Kancaaniniyinta wadanka ka saran sidii lagu xukumay darted.Israa’iiliyintii waxay bilaabeen inay cabudaan asanamta aay reer Kancaan cabuudayeen xagay ka cabuudin lahayeen Ilaaha xaqa ah. Israa’iiliyintu may lahayn hogaamiye ama boqor haga iyaga, kadibna qof kaste waxa uu bilaabay inay sameeyan waxay raban ee uu qofku rabo.

As a result of this disobedience, God punished the Israelites by allowing them to be defeated by their enemies. These enemies stole from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years, the Israelites repented and asked God to rescue them.


Caasinimadii aay Ilaah casiyeen darted ayuu Ilaah ciqaabay Israa’iiliyinta oo waxa uu ka gacan sareysiiyey cadawogoodii si aay uga roonadan. Cadawogiina waxay xadeen Israa’iiliyintii, waxay burburiyeen handidoodii, qaar badan oo iyaga kamidana waay dileen. Sannadobadan kadib, Israa’iiliyintu waxay Ilaah weydisteen cafis iya nu iyaaga cadawoga ka badbaadiyo.

Then God provided a deliverer who rescued them from their enemies and brought peace to the land. But then the people forgot about God and started worshiping idols again. So God allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.


Kadib Ilaah wuxu usoo diray {deliverer} oo kasoo badbadiyeey cadawogooda iyagaa oo dhulki israa’iilna nabad ka dhigay. Laakiin dadkii waxay iloobeen inay Ilaah so badbaadiyeey markay dhibaataysanayee kadib markay nabad heleen ayeey waxay bilabeen inay cabuudan asanaam mar kale. Kadib Ilaah wuxu usoo diray Midyaantu oo u dhawa inay Israa’iilinta dagaal kaga adkadaan.

The Midianites took all of the Israelites’ crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared that they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.


Midyaantu waxay qaateen dhaman midhihii ama abuurkii aay Israa’iiliyinta toddoba sanno gudahood. Israa’iiliyintu aad ayeey uga cabsan jireen Midyaantu oo xatta mararka qaar waxay isku qarin jireen meelahaa gudaadka si aanloo arkin. Ugu danbeyntiina Ilaah ayeey u ooyeen inu badbaadiyo oo u dhibta ka saaro.

One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of Yahweh came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.”


Maalin, ayaa nin la yidhaa Gidcoon ayaa waxa uu abuurayay hadhuudh si aan Midyaantu u arkin oo anay xati.Malaga Ilaah ayaa u yimid oo ku yidhi Gidcoon, “Ilaah ayaa kula jira, xoog badanaha awooda leh. Tag oo ka badbaadi dadka reer Israa’iil cadawogooda Midyaanta.”

God told Gideon to tear down his father’s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God.


Gidcoon wuxu Ilaah ku amray inu baabiyo sanamka abihii. Gidcoon aad ayuu dadkii uga cabsaday, kadibna waxa uu sugay intay habeen ka noqonaysay. Habeenki markay gaadhay ayuu sanamkii abihii burburiyeey qurub qurub. Halkii uu sanamku aha ayuu ka dhisay meel Ilaah lagu cabudo oo loogu wanqalo.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-07.jpg?direct&}}


The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon’s house to kill him, but Gideon’s father said, “Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!” So he saved Gideon.


Subaaxi danbe ayeey dadkii arkeen sanamkii oo la burburiyeey, aad ayeey uga cadhooden. Waxay tageen gurigii Gidcoon si aay usoo dilaan laakiin Gidcoon abihii ayaa yiri, “ Idinku maxaad asanamtiina u cawinaysaa? Haday Ilaahyo xaqa yihiin, iyaguu ha isbadbaadiyaan!” sidaasna Gidcoon ayuu dadkii kaga badbaadiyeey rabay inay dilaan

Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.


Kadib midyaantii waxay mar labaad u yimaaden inay xadaan reer Israa’iil. Dad badan oo aan la tiring kareyn ayeey ahayeen. Gidcoon ayaa isugu yeedhay dadkii reer Israa’iil kuna yidhi dagaalama dhamantiin. Gidcoon laba calaamo ayuu Ilaah weydistay si uu u badbaadiyo  reer Israa’iil.

First, Gideon laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.


Ugu horeyntii, gidcoon wuxu dhulka dhigay maro wuxuna Ilaah dharabka subixi ku dulshubo marada oo anu dhulka ku shubin, Ilaah taasi wuu u sameeyey, Habeenki labaad, wuxu weydistay inu Ilaah marada dhulka taala qalajiyo laakiin dhulka uu wada dharab ka dhigo.Ilaahna sidaas wuu ka dhigay.

32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.


32,000 kun oo Israa’iiliyina ayaa u yimid Gidcoon,  lakiin Ilaah ayaa u sheegay inay aad dadku u badan yahiin. Kadib Gidcoon 22, 000 kun  ayuu  ku amray inay ku laabtan magaladoodi waayo aad ayeey u cabsanayeen inay dagaalaman. Ilaah ayaa Gidcoon ku yiri wali waxad haysta rag dagal yahaniina oo fara badan,  Kadibna Gidcoon dhamaan waxa uuu u kala diray guryahoodii laga reebo 300 oo askari.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-11.jpg?direct&}}


That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about a dream. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon will defeat Midian!” Gideon worshiped God.


Isla habeenkas Ilaah wuxu Gidcoon u sheegay, “Orad oo tag xeroyooyinka Midyaaninta kadibna dhagayso waxay aay leeyihiin, kadibna marka aad maqasho waxay ka sheekeynayaan dib uma cabsan doontid.”  Kadib isla habeenkas, Gidcoon wuxu tagay xeryaha Midyaaninta waxanu dhagaystay askari reer Midyaan oo saxibkii uga sheekaynayaa riyo. Marku uga sheekeyay ayuu ugu jawabay, “ Riyadani waxay ka dhigan tahay in Gidcooniyintu ka guulaysan doonan Midyaanta. Kadib marku Gudcoon warkii maqlay Ilaah ayuu cabuuday oo kalsoni ayuu helay.

Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see them.


Kadib Gidcoon wuxu ku so laabtay askartiisi mid kastena waxa uu siyeey hoon,  weel dhooba ah, iyo toosh. Kadib waxay weeraareen oo hareereyn meeshay aay Midyaantii aay sexanayeen. 300 ee askari waxay tooshashki ku qariyeen werlkii dhoobada ah si aanay iftiinka  u arag Midyaantu.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-13.jpg?direct&}}


Then, at the same time, Gideon's soldiers all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for God and for Gideon!”


Sido kale , isla markiiba Gidcooniyintii askartoodu waxay jabiyeen weelashi dhoobada ahayd ee aay ku qarinayeen iftiinka tooshashkooda. Waxanay ka dhawaajiyeen hoonankii iyaga ku dhawaqayaa, “ Warkanka Ilaah iyo Gidcooniyinta!”


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-14.jpg?direct&}}


God confused the Midianites, so that they started attacking and killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.


Ilaah ayaa ku sababy inay dawakhaan Midyaantu kadibna waxay bilaabeen inay isdilaan iyaga qudhoodu. Isla markaasna waxa loo yeedhay reer Israa’iil inay yimaadan guryahooda oo aay Gidcooniyiinta ka cawiyaan inay ka eryaan inta meesha ku hadhay Midyaanta. Kadibna qaar badan ayeey la yeen oo wixii kalena waxay ka sareen wadanka, 120,000 oo Midyaana ayaa isla maalinta dagaalka dhintay. Maalintaas Ilaah ayaa badbaadiyeey Israa’iiliyinta.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-15.jpg?direct&}}


The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.


Dadku waxay rabeen inay Gidcoon ka dhigtaan boqor, Laakiin Gidcoon ayaa si xikmadii ku jirto u diiday inu qaato xilka aay rabeen inay u magacaban iskaga, isla marka waxa uu ka codsaday inay siiyaan in ka mid ah lacagta uu ninkasta ka qaadtay cadowga. Gidcoon lacagtii ayaa la siiyeey oo waxay noqotay lacag aad u badan.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-16.jpg?direct&}}


Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon’s idol. God punished Israel again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another deliverer.


Kadib Gidcoon wax xun ayuu sameeyey. Waxa uu lacagtii ka sameyeey sanam, taasina waxay dadkii ka fogaysay inay Ilaaha xaqah. Waxanay bilabeen ina cabuudan sanamka Gidcoon, Ilaah ayaa ciqaab u soo diray Israa’iilinta waayo sanamka aay cabuudayaan darted, Cadowgoodi ayaa ka guulaystay iyaaga, Ugu danbeyntii Ilaah ayeey weydisteen cafis iyo danbi dhaaf, Ilaahna wuu ka aqbalay waxanu su diray ninkale oo samatabixiy ah.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-17.jpg?direct&}}


This pattern repeated many times: the Israelites would sin, God would punish them, they would repent, and God would save them. Over many years, God sent many deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.


Calaamadan  in badan ayaa lagu celceliyeey inay Israa’iiliyintu dadnbaabi doonan, oo Ilaah ciqaab aduunka korkiisa u soo dirii doono, kadibna aay cafis Ilaah weydisan doonan, Ilaahna cafin doono iyaga. Sanado aad u fara badan, ayuu Ilaah usoo diray samatabixiyaal farabadan oo Israa’iilinta ka badbaadiyeey cadowgooda.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-18.jpg?direct&}}


Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, strong, and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but he gave them what they wanted.


Ugu danbeyntii, dadkii Ilaah waxay weydiisteen boqor sida aay dadka kale ee aduunka kula noola aay lahayen, Waxay rabeen boqor aad uu dheer, oo xoogbadan oo dagalada horkicii kara. Ilaah ma rabiin codsashadooda waayo markaste waay casiyin jireen isaga laakiin wuu ka aqbalay waxay rabeen.
