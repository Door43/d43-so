Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any shame, because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.


<font 12pt line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff>Aabe Adaan (Cs) iyo hooyo Xawa (Cs) waxay si farxad ku jirta ugu noolayeen beerta Janaada ee Illaah (Swt) u sameeyey iyaaga, Midkoodna maryo ma qabin, laakiin iyaagu ma dareemeyn cawaradooda wayo ma jirin wax danbiya marka janada dhexdeed. Markaste iyagu Illaah (Swt) ayeey la sheekaysan jireen si toosa waxayna dhex socon jirinee beerta Janaada dhexdeed</font>

But there was a crafty snake in the garden. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?”


Laakiin Janaada waxa dhex joogay abeeso xun.Waxay abeesadii ku tidhi Hooyo Xawa (Cs). “ Runtii miyu Illaah(Swt) kugu yidhi ha cunin midho ku yaala dhirta Janaada dhexdeeda?” 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-03.jpg?direct&}}


The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.’”


Markaas ayeey u jawabtay, “ Illaah (Swt) wuxuu noo sheegay inaan cuno dhirta Janaada ku talaa oo dhan laga reebo geedka aqoonta ficaan iyo xumaha (Geedka danbiga). Waxanu Illaah (Swt) nagu yidhi,” Hadii aad cuntaan ama aad tabatan isaga, waad dhiman doont.’”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-04.jpg?direct&}}


The snake responded, “That is not true! You will not die. God knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does.”


Abeesadi ayaa u jawabtay tidhina, “ Arinkaasi  run maha.  Illaah ( Swt) wuu ogyahay markaad cuntaan mirahaas inaad isaga awoodisa oo kale aad yeelan doontan kadibna aad fahmi doontaan xumaha iyo wanaaga sidiisa oo kale.”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-05.jpg?direct&}}


The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.


Hooyo Xawa (Cs) ayaa aragatay in mirahaasi aay aad u qurux badan yihiin unaa muuqdaan qaar aad u macaan.Waxa kale oo aay rabtay inay noqoto mid kala fahanta xumaha iyo wanaaga, waxay so guraatay midhihii oo aay cuntay kadibna waxa qayb ka siisay ninkeedi Aabo Adaan (Cs) oo iyaada la socoday kadib isna mirihii ayuu cunay.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.


Islaa markii aay cuneen idhahoodi ayaa furmay, oo waxay ogaadeen inay qawan yihiin.Waxay isku dayeen inay jidhkooda astuuran oo aay caleenta toshan kana sameysataan dhar.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”


Aadan iyo Xawa (Cs) waxay maqleen sanqadhii Illaah (Swt) oo ka dhex maqleen beerta Janaada dhaxdeeda. Kadib labadoodiba way is qariyeen. Illaah (swt) ayaa la hadlay Aadan (Cs) kuna yiri, “ xageed joogta?” Aadan ( Cs) ayaa u jawabay Illaah (Swt) oo yiri, “ Waxa Illaahow (Swt) maqlay adigo beerta dhex socda, kadib waan cabsaday maxaa yeelay waan qawana, oo waan iska ka qarinaayeey.”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-08.jpg?direct&}}


Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”


Kadib Illaah (Swt) ayaa ku yidhi, “ Yaa ku sheegay inaad qaawantahay? Ma waxaad cuntay mirihii aan ku idhi ha cuniin?” 


Aadan (Cs) ayaa Illaah (Swt) ku jaawab celiyeey oo ku yiri, “ Gabadhan Xawa adiga isiyeey, iyaana ayaada isiisay miraha.” Kadib Illaah (Swt) ayaa gabadhii la hadlay kuna yiri, “ Maxaad sameysay?” Gabadhii ayaa u jawabtay Illaah (Swt) waxayna ku tiri, “ Abeesadii ayaa I khiyaantay.”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-09.jpg?direct&}}


God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”


Illaah Swt) ayaa abeesadi ku yiri, “ Waan ku habaray! beerka ayaad ku soco doonta wasakhdaana waad cuni. Adiga iyo gabadhu waydun is nicii, ciyaalkinuna way isnicii sido kale. Naagta fareceeda ayaa madax ka burburin, adiguna boqontiisa ayaad dhaawici.”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-10.jpg?direct&}}


God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”


<font 12pt line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;/ ;;#000000;;#ffffff>Illaah(Swt) wuxu ku yiri gabadadhi. “ Markaad dhalayso ciyaalka ayaan xumad kaga dhigay. inuu ninkagu ku xukumo oo u ku taliyoo ayaan ka yeelay.”</font> 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-11.jpg?direct&}}


God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life-giver,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.


Illaah (Swt) wuxuu ninki ku yiri, “ Waxaad warkeedi dhageysatay naagtada aniga waad ii adeeci weyday. Hada dhulka waan in karay, aad aayad ugu bahantahay inaad dhulka uga shaqaysato oo aad cunto kala so baxdo. Kadibna waad dhiman doonta oo jirkagu dhulka ayuu ku laaban doona.” Kadib ninki wuxu u bixyeey naagtisi Xawa oo macneehedu yahay “ nolol bixisio,” waayo waxay noqon doonta hooyada dadka oo dhan kadib Illaah (Swt) dhar ayuu u galiyeey uu uga sameeyey maqaarka xoolaha.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-12.jpg?direct&}}


Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.


Kadib Illaah (Swt) wuxu ku yiri, “ Iminka laga bilaabo bini aadanku waxay noqdeen anaago kale waayo waxay kala garanayaan xumaha iyo wanaaga, waa inaan loo ogolaan inay cunaan geedaha noolosha ee lagu noolaado waligeed.” Kadib Illaah (Swt) Janaada wuu ka soo saaray Aadan iyo Xawa (Cs).Kadib Illaah (Swt) wuxu dhigay Janaada malaa’iigo aad u quwad badan si aan Janaada lo so gelin loona cunin geedaha noolosha aan dhimashada lahayn keena.
