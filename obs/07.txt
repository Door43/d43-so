As the boys grew up, Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau. Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt.


Markay wiilashi waa weynadeen, Rubeekha waxay jecelatay wiilkeeda yacquub, lakiin Aabihi Isaaq wuxu jecla wiilkisa weyn ee Ceesow.  Yacquub wuxu jecela inu guriga had iyo jeer joogo, lakin Ceesow wuxu jeclaa inu ugaadhsi tago.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Please give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, give me your rights as the oldest son.” So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.


Malin ayuu Ceesow yimid guriga isaago gaajoonayaa, oo kaso daaley ugaadhsi, wuxuuna weydisatey yacquub kibis iyo fuud digir laga sameeyey. Yacquubna wuxuu ugu jawabey, “waan ku sinayaa hadaad iga ibinayaso lahansha dhaxal qadashadaad.”

Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put goat skins on his neck and hands.


Kadib Ceesow wuxu ugu jawab celiyeey Yacquub, “ Maxay tahay dhaxal qadashadu? Naftaba gaajo iga baxaysee.”

Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau, I have come to receive your blessing.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.


Isaaq wuxu rabay inu barakadiisa siiyo Ceesow. Lakiin inta anu siinin Rubeekha iyo Yacquub ayaa isaga khiyameeyey wayo Yacquub ayaa iskaga so dhigay Ceesow. Isaaq waxba indhaha kama arkayn wayo wuu gaboobay. Kadib Yacquub ayaa xirtay dharki Ceesow iyo harag uu iska saray luqunta iyo gacmaha.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had taken his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.


Yacquub ayaa u yimid aabihi Isaaq kuna yiri, “ Waxan ahay Ceesow, waxan kugu imid inaad ducadaada i siiso. “ Marku Isaaq arakay haragi  oo uu uriyeey dharkiisi, wuxu u maleeyey inu yahay Ceesow oo ducadi iyo barakadii ayuu siiyay.


Ceesow aad ayuu u neceba Yacquub maxa yeelay Yacquub barakadi aabihi uu xaqa u laha ayuu ka qaaday waya isaga ayaa ka weyna, Kadib wuxu isku qorshaystay inu dilo Yacquub marku aabihi dhinto.

But Rebekah heard of Esau’s plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.

Lakiin Rubeekha ayaa  maqashay qorshaha uu Ceesow rabo inu ku dilo walalkiis. Kadib hooyadi iyo aabihi  u direen Yacquub inu u tago hooyadi qarabadeed.\\

Jacob lived there for many years, and during that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.


Yacquub wuxu la noola muddo dheer qarabada hooyadi, lakiin wakhatigaas wuu guursaday waxan dhalay laba iyo toban wiil iyo hablaba. Ilaah(Swt) wuxu ka dhigay isaga qani tijaara.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.


Marku Yacquub ka maqna wadankiisa Kanaan mudo labatan sanno ah, ayuu ku so laabtay gurigoodi isaago wata qoyskisii, shaqalihisii iyo dhamaan xoolihiisi oo dhan.

Jacob was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent Esau many herds of animals as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “These animals are a gift from your servant, Jacob. He is coming soon.”


Yacquub aad ayuu u cabsi qabay marku dhaxda ku so jiray safarkiisi wuxu moodayay in wali Ceesow rabo inu dilo isaga. Makas ayuu Ceesow siiyeey xoolo fara badan hadiyad ahan.  Shaqalihii Yacquub ayaa markay xoolaha u keenen ku yiri Ceesow, “ Xoolaha waa hadiyad ka timid adeegaha, Yacquub. Horena wuu kugu imanayaa.”

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happily reunited. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.


Lakiin Ceesow horeba wuu u cafiyeey yacquub, oo marku yimidna si farxadi ku jirto ayeey dib u wada noolayeen, Yacquubna si nabadi ku jirto ayuu dhulki Kanaan ugu noola. Kadib aabahod  Isaaq wuu dhintay weyna wada  dugeen meydkisi isaga.  Axdigii uu Ilaah(Swt) ugu balan qaaday Ibraahim kadibna Isaaq waxa barkadi helay Yacquub.
