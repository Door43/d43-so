At last it was time for the Israelites to enter Canaan, the Promised Land. Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho. It was protected by strong walls. A prostitute named Rahab protected the spies and helped them escape because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and her family when Jericho was destroyed.


Ugu danbeyntii waxay gaadhay xiligii aay reer Israa’iil ayaa geli lahayeen Kancaan, dhulka loogu balamn qaaday. Yashuuca waxa uu u diray laba basaas inay tagan dhulka kancaanita ee magalada Yerixoo. Waxa halkaas ku yaalay gidaaro aad loo adkeyeey.  Kabadh ka tirsan naagaha xun ee jidhkooda ka ganacsada oo la yira Raxab ayaa labadii basaas cawisay inay baxasadan waayo naag Ilaah rumaysan ayeey ahayd. Waxay ugu balan qaadeen inay Raxab iyo qoyskeeda la ilaali doono marka Yerixoo aay so weeraryan baabinayna.

The Israelites had to cross the Jordan River to enter into the Promised Land. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests’ feet touched the Jordan River, the water stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over on dry ground.


Israa’iiliyintu waxay ka talabeen webiga urdun si aay dhulka loogu balan qaaday aay tagan. Ilaah ayaa wuxu u sheegay Yashuuca, “ Inay imaamadu hor maraan intay safarka ku si jiraan.” Markay imaamadi aay lug tooda tabatay webiga Udrun, bihii webiga dhex socday ayaa joogsatay Israa’iiliyinta webiga oo qalalan ayeey ka talabeen.

After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. The soldiers and priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.


Markay dadkii ka talabeen webiga urdun, Ilaah ayaa la hadaay Yashuuca una sheegay sidii aay u dagalamii lahayeen magalada awooda badan ee Yerixoo.

On the seventh day, the Israelites marched around the city seven times. On the last time around the city, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew on their trumpets.


Maalintii todobad, ayeey Israa’iilintii socod ku mareen todoba jeer magalada hareraheeda. Markii ugu danbeysay ayeey askarii ku cabadeen inay imaamadu afuufan siidhiga dagalaka.

Then the walls around Jericho fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God had commanded. They only saved Rahab and her family, who became part of the Israelites. When the rest of the Canaanites heard about what had happened to Jericho they were terrified.


Kadib gidaaradii Yerixoo ayaa kala jabay. Israa’iiliyintii way jabjabiyeen dhaman wixi magalada dhex yalay sidii uu Ilaah ku amray. Waxa qudha aay badbaadiyeen Raxab iyo qoyskeedi, oo ka mid noqday  Israa’iiliyinta, Markay intii hadhay ee Kancaaniyiintii maqleen waxay Yerixoo ka dhacay aad ayeey u cabsadeen.

God had commanded the Israelites not to make peace with any of the people groups in Canaan. But the Canaanite people group of Gibeon lied to Joshua and said they were from far away. They asked Joshua to make peace with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua made peace with them.


Ilaah wuxu ku amray Israa’iiliyinta inanay wax nabada la sameeyen dadka ka tirsan Kancaaniyiinta mid naba. Laakiin dad Kancaaniyinta ka tirsana Gibecoon ayaa Yashuuca been u sheegay oo ku yidhi anagu kama tirsaniin kancaaniyinta oo meel fog ayaan ka nimid. Waxayna Yashuuca ka codsadeen inuu nabad la sameeyo iyaga. Laakiin Yashuuca iyo dadka reer Israa’iil toona Ilaah may weydiin meesha aay Gibecoontu ka timid. Kadibna Yashuuca wuu la heshiyeey Gibecoontii.

When the other people groups in Canaan heard that the Gibeonites had made peace with the Israelites, they joined their armies and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.


Markay dadkii kale ee Kancaaniyintu maqleen in Gibecoontii heshi la saxeexdeen Israa’iiliyinta, ayeey waxay soo urursadeen hubkoodii waxanay werareen Gibecoontii. Kadibna Gibecoontii fariin ayeey Yashuuca u direen aay ka codsanayaan inu dagaalka ka cawiyo.

Joshua was angry that he had been tricked, but he gathered the Israelite army, and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning they surprised their Canaanite enemies and attacked them.


Yashuuca aad ayuu u cadhooday sida aay Gibecoontu beenta ugu sheegtay laakiin Israa’iiliyintii ciidankoodii ayuu so uruuriyeey kadib habeenki oo dhan ayeey isdaba galeen si aay u gadhaan Gibecoonta. Kadibsubaxi hore ayeey ka yabiyeen Kancaanintii oo aha cadowgoodi wanay werareen iayaga.

God threw the Canaanites into confusion. God fought for Israel that day by sending large hailstones that killed many of the Canaanites.


Kancaaninta Ilaah ayaa ku tuuray jahwareer. Ilaah ayaa maalinta cawiyeey Israa’iilinta markasu Kancaaniyintii ku rogay dhagax waaweyn oo qaar badan oo kamid ah dilay.

God also made the sun stand still in the sky so that Israel could finish defeating the Canaanites. God won a great victory for Israel that day.


Ilaah isla maalinta qoraxada ma ridiin oo wali cirka ayeey dul joogtay si aay Israa’iiliyintu oo dhameeyan iskana difaacan Kancaaniyinta. Ilaah aya maalinta guuleyey Israa’iiliyinta.

After this defeat, the Canaanites who were left gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.


Kadib markay iska difaaceen, Intii hadhay Kancaaniyinta intay isa soo urursadeen ayeey u dagaal tageen Israa’iilinta. Yashuuca iyo ciidankiisii Isra’iiliyinta ayaa la dagalamay wayna buburiyeen iyagii.

After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel its own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.


Dagalka ka dib, Ilaah wuxu siyeey qole kaste oo ka tirsanayd israa’iil dhul u gaara oo kamid aha dhulkii Ilaah uu ugu balan qaaday. Kadib Ilaah nabad ayuu siisey Israa’iil iyo  xuduudahooda ku hareeraysan oo dhan

When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua renewed the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his laws.


Marku Yashuuca uu gaboobay, wuxu isgu yeeray dhamaan reer bini Israa’iil oo dhan. Kadib Yashuuca wuxu cusuboonaysiyeey axadigii Ilaah la galay reer Israa’iil markii aay joogen buurta Siinay. Dadkina waxay balan qaaden inay daacad Ilaah noqon doonan raciina doonan sharcigiisa wanagsan ee aan khaladka lahayn
