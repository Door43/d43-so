Jesus had been preaching for about three years. It was the time of the Passover Feast when the Jews remembered how God had saved them from slavery in Egypt many centuries earlier. Jesus knew what would happen to him and told his disciples he was going to Jerusalem where he would be killed.


Ciise waxa uu dacwada uu baafinayeey saddex sanno.  Waxa aay aheyd maalintii Iidda kormeerida ee aay Yahuudu uu Ilaahay ka soo saaray adoonsigii Masarida qarniyo fara badan ka hor inta aanu Ciise dhalan. Ciise wuu oga waxa isaga ku dhici doona waanu u sheegay xertiisa inu Yeruuslaam tegi doono halkaasna lagu dili doono.

The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem refused to believe that Jesus was the Messiah and were plotting to kill him. Judas was one of Jesus’ disciples. He was in charge of the disciples’ money bag, but he loved money and often stole from it. Judas went to the Jewish leaders and offered to betray Jesus to them.


Wadaada Yahuudu ee Yeruuslaam waxay diideen inay rumeystaan Ciise inu yahay Masiixa waxanay qorsheysteen inay dili doonan isaga. Yudaas waxa uu ka mid aha xerta Ciise.  Waxa uu u qaabilsana lacagta xerta Ciise oo aad ayuu lacagta u jecela oo inta badan wuu xadi jiray. Yudaas  waxa uu u tegay wadaada Yahuuda waxanu ka codsaday inu isagi Ciise u soo gacan geli karo.

The Jewish leaders, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty pieces of silver to betray Jesus. This happened just as the prophets had predicted. Judas agreed, took the money, and went away, looking for a chance to help them arrest Jesus.


Hogamiyeyashi Yahuuda oo uu hor kacayo wadadka ugu sareeya ayaa waxay bixiyeen soddon gogo' oo lacag ah oo aay siyeen Yudaas si uu Ciise ugu so gacan geliyo. Sidaasna waxa sii sadaliyeey nebiyashii hore. Yuudas wuu la heshiiyeey wadaadii lacagtiina wuu qaatay waanu uska tegay isaga oo raadinaya sidii uu Ciise u soo gacan gelin laha.

Jesus celebrated the Passover Feast with his disciples. During the meal Jesus took bread and broke it, saying, “Take and eat this. It is my body, which is broken for you. Do this to remember me.” In this way, Jesus said that his body would be sacrificed for them.


Ciise waxa uu u dabaal degay Iiddi Kormarista isaga iyo xertiisba. Oo intay wax cunayeen, Ciise ayaa kibis qaaday oo barakeeyey, wuuna jejebiyey oo xertii siiyey oo yidhi, Qaata oo cuna. Tanu waa jidhkaygiiye.

Then Jesus took a cup and said, “Drink this. It is my blood of the New Covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me as often as you drink it.” In this way, Jesus said that his blood would be poured out to forgive their sins.


Markaasu Ciise koobkii qaaday oo mahadnaqay oo siiyey iyaga, oo wuxuu ku yidhi, Kulligiin ka cabba.  Waayo, kanu waa dhiiggayga axdiga cusub kan kuwo badan loo daadshay dembidhaafkooda aawadiis.

Then Jesus said to the disciples, “One of you will betray me.” The disciples were surprised and did not know who would do such a thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread is the betrayer.” Then he gave the bread to Judas.


Markaasu Ciise yiri, oo intay wax cunayeen ayuu ku yidhi, “Runtii waxaan idinku leeyahay, Midkiin ayaa i gacangelin doona.” Markaasay aad iyo aad u caloolxumaadeen, oo waxay bilaabeen in mid kastaa ku yidhaahdo, Ma aniga baa, Sayidow? Wuu u jawaabay oo wuxuu ku yidhi, Kii saxanka gacanta ila gesha kaasaa i gacangelin doona. Markaasu Yuudas siyeey rootidii.

After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Judas left to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. It was night.


Kadib marku Yudaas qaatay rootigii ayaa waxa galay shaydaan. Kadib Yuudas wuu baxay si uu ugu gacan geliye Ciise wadaada Yahuuda. Waxa aay aheyd habeen.

After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, “All of you will all abandon me tonight. It is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and all the sheep will be scattered.’”


Cuntaadi Ka bacdii, Ciise iyo xertiisi waxa aay u lugeeyeen buurta Saytuun. Markasu  Ciise yiri, “ Dhamaantiin cawa waad ii dafirii doontan. Waay qorantahay, ‘Waxan garacii doon adhi jirka kadib adhiga oo dhan way cararii doonan waanay kala yaaci doonan.’”

Peter replied, “Even if all the others leave you, I will not!” Then Jesus said to Peter, “Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, three times you will deny that you even know me.”


Butros ayaa yidhi, “ Haddi aay kuwa kale oo dhan kaa tagan, anigu kama tagayo! kadib Ciise ayaa ku yidhi Butros, “ Shaydaanka ayaa dhamaantiin idin raba inu idin yeesho, laakiin aniga ayaa idinka duceeyey,  Butrosow, adiga rumeysadkagu ma xumaan doono ayuu Ciise ku yidhi. Xatta cawa inta aan tiigu ciyin, waxad I dafirii oo aad ii garan wayii doonta saddex jeer.”

Peter then said to Jesus, “Even if I must die, I will never disown you!” All the other disciples said the same thing.


Butros ayaa Ciise ku yidhi, “ Xatta hadii aan dhimanayo, anigu adiga ku dafiri maayo!” dhamaan xertii kale oo dhan ayaa sidaas iyaguna yidhi.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples to pray that they would not fall into temptation. Then Jesus went to pray by himself.


Kadib Ciise iyo xertiisi waxay tageen Beer Getsemane. Markuu meeshii joogay ayuu ku yidhi, tukada inaydnaan jirrabaadda gelin. Kadib Ciise wuu ka tagay oo kaligii ayuu tukaday.

Jesus prayed three times, “My Father, if it is possible, please let me escape this suffering. But if there is no other way for people’s sins to be forgiven, then let your will be done.” Jesus was very troubled and his sweat was like drops of blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him.


Ciise ayaa saddex jeer tukaday, isagoo leh, Aabbow, haddaad doonaysid, koobkan iga fogee, hase ahaatee, doonistaydu yaanay noqon, taaduse ha noqoto. Markaasaa waxaa samada kaga muuqatay malaa'ig isaga xoogaynaysa.  Isagoo aad u xanuunsan ayuu dadaal ku tukaday, dhididkiisuna wuxuu noqday sida dhibicyo dhiig ah oo dhulka ku dhacaya

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. After the third time, Jesus said, “Wake up! My betrayer is here.”


Goortuu tukashadiisii ka soo kacay, ayuu xertii u yimid oo wuxuu arkay iyagoo caloolxumo la hurda. Markii ugu danbeysay ee Ciise tukaday ayuu u yimid markaasuu ku yidhi, Maxaad u huruddaan? “Kaca oo tukada inaydnaan jirrabaadda gelin. Ninkii I gacan gelin lahana halkan ayuu jooga.”

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd carrying swords and clubs. He came to Jesus and said, “Greetings, teacher,” and kissed him. This was the sign for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, “Judas, do you betray me with a kiss?”


Intuu weli hadlayay, bal eeg, waxaa yimid dad badan, oo kii Yuudas la odhan jiray oo laba-iyo-tobanka ka mid ahaa ayaa hortooda socday. Wuxuuna u soo dhowaaday Ciise inuu dhunkado. Laakiin Ciise wuxuu ku yidhi, Yuudasow, ma waxaad Wiilka Aadanaha ku gacangelinaysaa dhunkasho?”


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-38-15.jpg?direct&}}


As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant. Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father.” Then Jesus healed the man’s ear, and all the disciples ran away.


Marku askarigii xidhay Ciise. Butros wuxuu ku dhuftay wadaadka sare addoonkiisii, oo dhegta midigta ka gooyay. Ciise ayaa yidhi, “ Seefta iska dhiga! Waxan weydiisan laha Aabahay inay malaa’iigu hubaysan I difaacan. Laakiin waa inaan adeeca Aabahay.” Ciise ayaa u jawaabay oo ku yidhi, Sii daaya. Markaasuu dhegtiisa taabtay oo bogsiiyey.
