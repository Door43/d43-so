God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then he would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.


Ilaah wuxu u digay inu Fircoon hadii u fasaxi wayo Israa’iiliyinta, inu dili doona dhamaan curudka wiilasha dad iyo xoolaba. Marku xatta warka maqlay wuu diiday inu Fircoon Ilaah rumaysto.

God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone who believed in him. Each family had to choose a perfect lamb or goat and kill it.


Ilaah wuu badbaadiyeey curadka  qof kaste oo isaga rumeystay. Qoyskasta waxa lagu ammray inay qalan neef  lax ama riya oo ficaan.

Then the Israelites needed to put some of its blood around the door of their house. They were to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was made without yeast. They were to be ready to leave Egypt when they ate.


Kadib Israa’iiliyntii waxay aheyd inay albaabadooda dhiig mariyaan kadibna adhiga neefka aay dubtaan cunan hilibkisa kuna cunaan roodhi daqiiq laga sameeyey sida ugu dhakhsiyaha badan. Waxanay aheyd markay cunaan inay sida ugu dhakhsiyaha badan uga tagan Masar.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. In the middle of the night, God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.


Israa’iiliyuntu waxay sameeyey dhaman wuxu Ilaah ku ammray inay suubiyaan oo dhan. Marku habeenki kala badhmay, ayuu Ilaah wada dilay dhamaan wiilashi curadaada Masarida aha oo dhan.

All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so God passed over those houses and everyone inside was safe. They were saved because of the lamb’s blood.


Dhaman guriyihii Israa’iiliynta waxa marsana dhiig, kadib way ka badbaadeen  dhibaatii oo dhan  waayo dhiigi la faray inay albaabada marsadan.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands. So God did not pass over their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons and every firstborn of their animals as well.


Laakiin Masaridii diday inay Ilaah rumeeyan ama adeeci waayay  dhamaan Ilaah wuxu ka layeey wiilashii curadadoodi iyo xoolahoodi.

Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh. There was much weeping in Egypt.


Wiil kaste oo curad aha Masarida wuu dhintay, xatta kuwi jeelasha ku jiray, xatta wiilki Fircoon. Masaridu aad ayeey uga dhex oo yeen wadankoodi Masar.

That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptian people also urged the Israelites to leave right away.


Isla habeenkas, Fircoon wuxu u yeedhay Muuse iyo Haruun wuxuna ku yidhi. “  Kaxeeye Israa’iilinta oo ka wada Masar sida ugu dhakhsiyaha badan!”  Dadka masariduna waxay Israa’iilinta ku yidhahadeen hada naga baxa.
