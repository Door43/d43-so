Stephen was a leader in the early Church. He had a good reputation and was full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom. Stephen did many miracles and argued strongly that people should believe in Jesus.


Istefanos waxa uu aha hogamiyihii ugu horeyey Kiniisada. Waxa uu aha nin sharaf leh oo Ruuxa Quduuska ah ayaa xigmad badan siyeey. Istefanos waxa uu sameyey mucjiso fara badan aadna waxa uu ugu dhiri gelin jiray inay dadku Ciise rumeystan.

One day, Stephen was arguing with some unbelieving Jews about Jesus. They became very angry and lied about Stephen, saying, “We heard him speak evil things about Moses and God!” So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high priest and leaders of the Jews.


Maalin ayuu Istefanos ayaa waxa uu la mur maayeey qaar Yahuuda oo aan Ciise rumeysneyn. Aad ayeey uga cadhoodeen oo been ayeey ka abuurteen isaga. Iyaga oo dhahayaa, “ Waxanu maqalnay ninka oo wax xun kaga hadlayaa Muuse iyo Ilaahay!” kadib waxa la xidhay Istefanos waxana la hor keenay wadaadka diinta ugu sareeya iyo hogamiyaayasha diinta ee Yahuuda.

The high priest asked Stephen, “Are these things true?” Stephen reminded them of all the great things God had done from the time of Abraham to Jesus. Then he replied, “You stubborn and rebellious people always reject the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors always rejected God and killed his prophets. You have even killed the Messiah whom God sent!”


Wadaadkii ugu sareeyey diinta ayaa waxa uu Istefanos weydiyeey, “ Warkan lagaa sheegaya ma runba?” Kadib Istefanos waxa uu dhamaantood xasuusiyey wax yabihii wanagsana ee aay sameyn ilaa Ibrahim iyo Ciise.  Kadib wax uu ku celiyeey isaha oo leh, “ Nimanyoow qalbiga adag ee Ilaahay ka foogaday waxa aad diidan Ruuxa Quduuska ah, sida aay faraciina u diideen Ilaahay una leyn jireen nebiyadii loo so diray. waxa uu ku yidhi xatta waxa aad disheen Masiix oo Ilaah so diray!”

When the people heard this, they covered their ears and yelled loudly. They threw Stephen out of the city and stoned him to death.


Markay dadkii maqleen arinkii, inta aay dhagaha dabooshen oo aay aad u qayliyeen ayeey Istefanos magalada ka saareen oo dhagax ayeey ku dileen.

As Stephen was dying, he cried out, “Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he fell to his knees and cried out again, “Master, do not count this sin against them.” Then he died.


Intii uu Istefanos sii dhimanayeey waxa uu ku barooranayey, “ Ciisoow, ruuxdayda iga qaad,” kadib inta uu hoos u dhacay ayuu mar labaad yidhi, “ Sayidow, waxba ha u xisaabin  denbiga aay iga galeen.” Kadib wuu dhintay.

A man named Saul approved of Stephen’s execution and guarded the belongings of those who stoned Stephen. That day many people started persecuting the Christians, and they were scattered through that region. But everywhere they went they preached about Jesus.


Nin lagu magacabi jiray Sawlos ayaa xukumay in la dilo Istefanos oo u ilaalinayay hantidooda maalinta kuwa soo dhax tuuray Istefanos. Isla maalinta waxa bilaamay in dadka Masiixiyinta la dilo kadib waxa aay u kala yaaceen gobolada. Laakiin meel kaste oo aay tageen waxa aay baafinayeen warka wanagsan ee Ciise.

Philip, one of Jesus' disciples, went to Samaria where he preached about Jesus and many were saved. Then one day an angel from God told Philip to go to the road to Gaza in the desert. As he walked along the road, Philip saw an important official from Ethiopia riding in his chariot. The Holy Spirit told Philip to go up and talk to this man.


Laakiin Rabbiga malaa'igtiisa ayaa waxay la hadashay Filibos, iyadoo ku leh, Kac oo aad xagga koonfureed, oo waxaad raacdaa jidka Yeruusaalem ka taga ilaa Gaasa taasoo cidla ah.  Wuuna u kacay oo aaday; oo waxaana ku soo baxay nin bohon oo Xabashi ah oo amar weyn ka hoos hayay Kandake boqoraddii Xabashida, wuuna u talin jiray maalkeeda oo dhan, wuxuuna Yeruusaalem u yimid inuu Ilaah caabudo.

When Philip came near the chariot, he heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah, “He was led like a lamb to be killed, and did not say a word. He was treated unfairly and without respect. His life was taken away from him.”


Kolkuu ka soo noqonayay, ayuu ku fadhiyey gaadhifaraskiisa, oo wuxuu akhriyeyey kitaabka nebi Isayos. “Isaga sidii wan la qalayo baa loo kaxeeyey; Oo sidii lax ku aamusan ninka dhogorta ka xiira hortiisa, Isagu afkiisa ma uu furo; Intuu is-hoosaysiiyey baa gartiisii laga qaaday; Farcankiisii yaa sheegi doona? Maxaa yeelay, noloshiisa dhulkaa laga qaaday.”

Philip asked the Ethiopian, “Do you understand what you are reading?” He said, “No. I cannot understand it unless someone explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. Is Isaiah talking about himself or someone else?”


Oo Filibos markuu ku orday, wuxuu maqlay isagoo akhriyaya kitaabka nebi Isayos, wuxuuna ku yidhi, Ma garanaysaa waxaad akhriyaysid? Kolkaasuu yidhi, Sidee baan ku garan karaa in lay toosiyo mooyaane? Markaasuu Filibos ka baryay inuu soo fuulo oo la fadhiisto. Haddaba meeshuu Qorniinka ka akhriyeyey waa tan, Bohonku wuxuu Filibos u jawaabay oo ku yidhi, Waxaan kaa baryayaa, Nebigu yuu ka hadlayaa? Ma isaga qudhiisaa mise waa mid kale?

Philip showed him that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. Philip also used many other Scriptures to tell him the Good News of Jesus.


Filibos baa afkiisa furay, waxanu tusay iny Isayos isagu iska hadlayeey .oo intuu Qorniinkan ka bilaabay ayuu isaga ku wacdiyey warka wanagsan Ciise.

As they passed by some water, the Ethiopian said, “Look! There is some water! May I be baptized?” And he ordered the chariot to stop.


Markaasuu amray in gaadhigu joogsado; labadooduna biyahay galeen, Filibos iyo bohonkuba, oo wuu baabtiisay isaga.

So they went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. After Philip baptized the Ethiopian, the Holy Spirit carried Philip away to another place where he continued telling people about Jesus.


Oo markay biyihii ka soo baxeen, ayuu Ruuxii Rabbigu dhuftay Filibos, bohonkuna mar dambe ma uu arkin isagii, maxaa yeelay, jidkiisii ayuu iska qaaday isagoo faraxsan. Laakiin Filibos waxaa  magaalooyinkuu dhex marayay oo dhan wuxuu ku wacdiyey injiilka ilaa intuu gaadhay Kaysariya.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-45-13.jpg?direct&}}


The Ethiopian went on his way, happy to know Jesus.


Ninki Xabashiga  ahana wuu iska tegay, isaga oo faraxsan inu ogaado Ciise.
