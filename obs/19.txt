Throughout the history of the Israelites, God sent them prophets. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the people God’s messages.


Dhamaan tariikhda reer bini israa’iil. Ilaahay nabiyaal ayuu u so diray. Nabiyaashaasi farinta aay Ilaah ka maqlan ayeey u so gudbin jireen dadka aay u yihiin nabiga.

Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over Israel. Ahab was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false god named Baal. Elijah said to Ahab, “There will be no rain or dew in Israel until I say so.” This made Ahab very angry.


Eliiyaah marku ahaa nabiga waxa boqorka guud ee reer Israa’iil aha Ahaab. Ahaabna waxa uu aha nin xun oo aan xaqa ku dhaqmin oo dadka ku dhiiri geliya inay cabuudan asanaamta beenta aha oo id lagu magacabi jiray Baal. Eliiyaah waxa uu Ahaab ku yiri, “  Roob ma imaan doono ama tiix tiix ilaa aan anigu idha mooye, “ tani waxay ka cadhaysiisay Ahaab.

God told Elijah to hide in the wilderness near a stream. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.


Ilaahay wuu Eliiyaah ku ammray inu duurka isku qariyo oo meel biya maareena u dhow. Subax kaste iyo habeenkastana shimbiro ayaa waxay u keenayeen nabi Eliiyaah rooti iyo hilib. Ahaab iyo ciidankiisi waxay raadinayeen nabi Eliiyaah, laakiin  may helin isaga, abaara aad u daran ayaa dhacday xatta marki danbe meeshi biya mareenadii ayaa engaagey.

So Elijah went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son had almost run out of food because of the famine. But they took care of Elijah, and God provided for them so that their flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there a long time.


Kadib Eliiyaah waxa uu tagay dalalkii jaarka ahaa eek u dhawa. Gabadh caramalaa iyo wiilkeedi ayaa waxa ka dhamaaday rashiinkii waayo abaarta darted, Laakiin aad ayeey u xanaaneyeeyn, kadib Ilaahay ayaa aad uu u qudiyeey reerki oo burka iyo saliida kama dhamaan jirin jiri kankooda. Raashin ku filan ayeey haysteen intii abaartu socotay oo dhan. Eliiyaah in badan ayuu la joogay iyaga.

After three and a half years, God told Elijah to return to Israel and speak with Ahab because he was going to send rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah said, “You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned Yahweh, the true God, and worshiped Baal. Bring all of Israel to Mount Carmel.”


Saddex sano iyo badh markay ka so wareegtay  marku Ilaahay Eliiyaah ku yiri ku laabo wadankii Reer bini Israa’iil oo la hadal Ahaab maxa yeelay roob ayuu keenaya mar labaad. Marku Ahaab arkay Eliiyah ayuu ku yiri, “ waakan ninki dhibta keeni jiray!” Markaasu Eliiyaah ku yiri, “ Adiga ayaa nin dhib badan aha! Adigu Ilaahay ayaad rumaysan ladahay, Ilaah xaqa lagu aammino, waxanad u cibaadaysata sanamka Baal. Keen dhamaaan dadk Reer Israa’iil buurta karmaal.”

All of Israel, including the 450 prophets of Baal, came to Mount Carmel. Elijah said to the people, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yahweh is God, serve him! If Baal is God, serve him!”


Dhamaan Reer Israa’iil oo aay ku jiraan 450  nabiyaashi sanabka Baal u adeegi jiray , ayaa yimid buurta Karmaal . Eliiyaah ayaa dadkii ku yirim “  intee in leeg ayaad maskaxdiina badali doontan? Hadii Ilaahay ku runta yahay, isaga u aadeegaa! Hadii Sanamka Baal yahay Ilaahay, isaga u aadeega!”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-07.jpg?direct&}}


Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Kill a bull and prepare a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The God who answers with fire is the real God.” So the priests of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.


Kadib Eliiyaah ayaa ku yiri nabiyaashi beenta aha ee Baal. “ neef dibiya qala oo u diyaariya wanqal ahaan, laakin wax dab aha ha diyariniina.  Aniguna sido kale. Kadib qolada uu Ilaahay dab u diyariyo ayaa aamminsan Ilaaha xaqa ah,” Kadib nabiyaashi beenta aha ee Baal ayaa neefki qalay oo isku diyariyeey hawashi wax dabana may shidin.

Then the prophets of Baal prayed to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer.


Kadib nabiyaashi beenta aha ee Baal waay tukaadeen iyagoo baryaay Baal oo leh, “ na maqal, baalow!”  Maalintii oo dhan waay tukanayeen oo xatta iyaga ayaa midiyo isku jaray laakiin Baal waxaba kama jawaabin.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-09.jpg?direct&}}


At the end of the day, Elijah prepared a sacrifice to God. Then he had twelve huge pots of water poured on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar were completely wet.


Markay maalintii dhamatay, ayuu Eliiyaah diyaariyeey alle barigii Ilaahay. Kadib Ilaahay ayaa laba iyo tobon caag iyo biyihii iyo hilibkii iyo xabaadii dhamaan ilahay samada uga so diray.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-10.jpg?direct&}}


Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that you are the true God.”


Kadib Eliiyaah ayaa Ilaahay baryeey, “ Ilaahayow, Ilaahi nabi Ibraahim, Isaaq iyo Yacquub abuurayow, na tus maanta inaad tahay Ilaaha xaqa aha ee Reer bibi Israa’iil oo aan anaa ahay adeegahagii. Ilaahow  fariin iso dir aay dadkani ku cimra qaatan kuguna rumaystaan inaad adigu tahay Ilaaha xaqa.”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-11.jpg?direct&}}


Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, and even the wet ground around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, “Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”


Isla markiiba Ilaahay ayaa samada ka so dejiyeey  hilib  gubanayaa, xaabo iyo dhagaxan iyo meelihi Ilaahaa lagu baryay oo dhan,  Markay dadkii arkeen , dhulka ayeey ku daateen waxanay yirahdeen, “ Ilaahay ayaa sareeya! Ilaahay ayaa sareeya!”


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-12.jpg?direct&}}


Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away and killed them.


Kadib Eliiyaah ayaa wuxu yiri, “ Dadkoow yaanu nebi beena oo u aadeega Baal meeshan ka baxasaniin!” dadkii waay qabqabteen dhamaantood. Kadibna Eliiyaah ayaa dhamaantood dilay.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-13.jpg?direct&}}


Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to the city, for the rain is coming.” Soon the sky grew black, and a large rain storm came. God had ended the drought and proved that he is the true God.


Kadib Eliiyaah waxa u ku nyidhi boqrkii Ahaab, “ ku laabo magalada , roob ayaa iman doone.” Isla markiba cirka ayaa madoobaday oo roob ayaa yimid, Kadib Ilaahay abaarti wuu ka dul qaaday dadki waxanu muujiyeey inu yahay Ilaaha runta ah.

After Elijah, God chose Elisha to be his prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to Naaman, an enemy commander, who had a horrible skin disease. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked Elisha to heal him. Elisha told him to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River.


Kadib Eliiyaah, Ilaahay wuxu doortay Eliishaa inu  noqdo nebi. Eliishaa mucjisooyin badan ayuu  sameeyey Ilaah dartiis. Waxa kamid aha markii Naamaan oo ah taliye cadawga Ilaah oo qabay xanuunka maqarka oo aad u daran uu maqlay nebi Eliishaa una tagay isaga oo weydisanayaa in uu caafiyo. Kadib Eliishaa ayaa ku yiri todobo jeer  webiga Urdun gal.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-15.jpg?direct&}}


At first Naaman was angry and would not do it because it seemed foolish. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! God had healed him.


Ugu horayntii Naamaan aad ayuu uga cadhooday warkii uu Eliishaa u sheegay waayo waxay ula muuqatay inay tahay doqonimo. Laakin masakaxadiisii ayuu badalay oo todobo jeer ayuu webiga gal. Marku ugui danbeyntii ka so baxay waxa uu arkay maqarkiisii oo bogsaday. Ilaahay ayaa caafiyeey.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-16.jpg?direct&}}


There were many other prophets. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not turn from their sins and start living obedient lives, then God’s judgment would come, and he would punish them.


Waxa jirey nabiyaal badan dhamaantood waxay dadka u sheegi jireen inay joojiyaan inaay cabuudan asnaabta oo aay cadalad iyo naxariis dadka u mujiyaan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-17.jpg?direct&}}


Most of the time, the people did not listen to God. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and pulled him out before he died.


Inta ugu badan, dadku ma ma maqlaan ammarka Ilaahay. Waxay xumeeyaan nebiyada looo so diro oo aay marmarka qaarkood dilaanba. Mar ayaa waxa dhacday in nebi Yeremaah inta lagu riday ceel qalalan ayaa halkaas lagaag tagay markaas ayuu halkaas ciidu liqi gaadhay laakin boqorkii ayaa ka naxay oo ka so saaray inta aanu dhiman.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-18.jpg?direct&}}


The prophets continued to speak for God even though the people hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did not repent. They also reminded people of the promise that God’s Messiah would come.


Nebiyaduu waxay si joogta ula hadli jireen Ilaahay inkasto aay dadku necbaayeeen. Waxay uga digi jireen in Ilaahay baa’biin doono haadi aaysan tobad keenin, Xatta waxay dadka ugu balan qaadi jireen in Masiixa Ilaahay iman doono.
