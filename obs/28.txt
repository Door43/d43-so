One day a rich young ruler came up to Jesus and asked him, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God’s laws.”


Maalin ayaa waxa Ciise u yimid nin yar oo hogaamiye ah ahna tijaara waxanu weydiyeey, “ Macalin, maxaa wanagsan ee aan sameeya si aan janaada u helo?” Ciise waxa uu ugu jawabay isagii, “ Maxaad aniga ii weydiinaysa waxa wanagsan? Mid qudha ayuunba wanagsan, kaasina waa Ilaahay. Laakin hadaad rabtiid inaad janaada gashi, sharciga Ilaahay adeec.”

“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.”


“Waa kuwe?” ayuu weydiyeey. Kadib Ciise ayaa ugu jawaab celiyeey, “ Waxba ha dilin. Ha sinaysan. Waxba ha xadin. Been ha sheegin. Aabaha iyo hoyaada xaq sii, oo jaarkaga jecelow sida aad naftaada u jeceshahay.”

The young man, trying to prove that he was right, said, “I have obeyed all these laws ever since I was a boy. What do I still need to do?” Jesus looked at him and loved him.


Ninkii yara ayaa rabay inu is cadeeyo inu sax yahay oo waxaas oo dhan uu sameeyo wanu yiri, “ Anigu waan adeecay sida sharciga oo dhan ku qoran ilaa intan yara ee aan inaka ah. Laakiin maxa kale ee aan sameeya? Ciise ayaa into eegay isaga ku qoslay.

Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure waiting for you in heaven. Then come and follow me.”


Ciise waxa uu ku yidhi, “ Hadaad rabtid inaad ficnaato, waxaad hanta haysto oo dhan iibi oo masakiinta sii kadib Ilaahay ayaa janaada ku dhigii waxaad aduunka baxaste. Kadib kaalay oo aniga iraac.”

When the young man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich. He turned and went away from Jesus, unwilling to give up his wealth.


Marku ninki yara warkaas maqlay, aad ayuu u murugooday maxa yeelay tijaar ayuu aha. Intu sii jeestay ayuu Ciise iskaga tegay isaga oo aan rabin inu hantiidisa bixiyo.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, “How hard it is for rich people to enter into the Kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”


Kadib Ciise ayaa ku yiri xertiisi, “ side ayeey u adag tahay inu qof tijaari galo boqortoyada Ilaahay iyo janaadisa! Haa, way fududahay inu neef geelo irbad caradeed maro inta uu nin tijaari geli laha boqortoyada Ilaahay iyo janaadisa.”

When the disciples heard this they were shocked and said, “Then who can be saved?”


Markay xeerti Ciise maqleen warkan aad ayeey u gariiren waxanay yirahdeen, “ Kadib yaa badbaadaya?”

Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.”


Ciise ayaa intu eegay ugu jawabay, “ Dadka tani ma sameeyn karan, laakiin Ilaahay wax kaste wuu sameyn kara.”

Peter said to Jesus, “We have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?”


Butros ayaa Ciise ku yidhi, “Wax kaste waan iskaga nimid si aan adiga ku raacno. Maxay tahay abaal marin tayadu?”

Jesus answered, “Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or property for my name’s sake, will inherit 100 times more in the next world and also eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.”


Ciise ayaa ugu Jawabay oo yidhi, ‘ Qof kaste oo ka taga gurigiisa, inamadooda, hablaahooda, aabihii, hoyadii, ciyaalkiisa iyo hantiidisa aniga daradey, waxa uu dhaxli doona 100 jeer in ka badan aduunka labaad waliba janaada ayuu ku noolan doona. Laakiin kuwa ugu soo horeya way danbeyn doonan, oo kuwa ugu danbeeyana way horeyn doonan”.
