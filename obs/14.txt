After the Israelites received God’s Covenant at Mount Sinai, God began leading them toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The cloud pillar showed them the way.


Kadib markay Israa’iiliyintii Helen axadigii Ilaah ee buurta Siinaym Ilaah wuxu ku hogamiyeey iyaga dhulki loogu balan qaaday ee loogu yeeri jiray Kacnaan. Daruur tiir ah ayaa hor kacaysay si aay dhulka aay ku socdeen u tusto..

God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many people groups living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not believe in God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.


Ilaah ayaa wuxu u balan qaaday Ibrahim, Isaaq iyo Yacquub inu siin doono dhulka kancan dhulka uu ugu balan qaaday iyaga iyo faracoodaba, laakiin  hadaa waxa jira dad badan oo halkaas ku nool. Waxa la odhan jiray Kancaanin, kuwaasina Ilaah may garanyeyn manyna rumeysnayn Ilaah. Waxay u cibaadeysan jireen asnaam waxayna sameyn jireen danbiyo aad u fool xun xun.

God told the Israelites, “You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not obey me, you will worship their idols instead of me.”


Ilaah wuxu u sheegay Israa’iiliyinta sidan, “ Waa inaad dhaman ka kaxaysan dadka Kancaaninta dhulka leydunku balan qaaday. Nabad ha la sameynina iyaga hana ka guursanina iyaga, Waa inaad buburisan dhamaan sanam yadooda. Hadeydan I adeecin aniga, waxad u cibaadaysan doontan asanamtooda.”

When the Israelites reached the edge of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.


Markay Israa’iiliyintii gadheen koonaha Kancaan, ayaa Muuse wuxu magacabay laba iyo toban nin, mid kaste waxa u kaso xulay laba iyo toban ka qolo ee Israa’iiliyinta, Wuxu amar ku siyeey nimaanki inay is raacan oo aay tagan dhulka sona basaasab waxa halkaas ku sugan iyo sida aay meeshu u eeg tahay. Waxa kale oo halkaas aay kaso basaasayeen inay Kancaaninintu aay xoog badan yihiin iyo inay itaal daran yihiin.

The twelve men spied on Canaan for forty days and then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a bad report, saying, “The land is very good, and the crops are great! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, we will surely die!”


Laba iyo tobanki nin ayaa so basaasay dhuli Kancaan afartan cisho gudahood kadibna way so laabteen. Toban ka mid aha nimankii wax so basaasayeey was xun ayeey lasoo laabteen, iyaga oo dhahaya sidan, “dhulku wuu fican yahay, abuurkuna wuu fican yahay! Laakiin magalooyunku aad ayeey u waa weynihiin, oo dadkuna aad ayeey u xoog badan yihiin, runtina hadii ayenu weerarno iyaga weynu wada dhimaan doona.

Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”


Isla wakhtigiiba Kaaleen iyo Yashuuca labadii basaas ee kale, ayaa waxay yirahadeen, “Waa run dadka reer Kancaan waa dad dhaadheer oo xoog badn, laakiin runtii waan iska difaaci karna! Ilaahna wuu ino hiilin doona!”


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-14-07.jpg?direct&}}


But the people were mad at Moses and Aaron and said, “Oh, why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves.” The people wanted to kill them and choose a new leader to bring them back to Egypt.


Laakiin dadku waxay aad uga cadhoonayeen Muuse iyo Haruun kuna lahayeen, “ Ax, maxaad no keenten meeshan dhibta badan? Waxan iska joogi lahayn Masar inti aan xagan dagalka ku dhiman lahayn oo xasaaskayga iyo caruurtayda laga dhigan laha addoomaha.” Dadkii waxay rabeen inay dilaan iyaga doortaana hogaamiye cusub oo ku celiya Masar.

God was very angry, and his presence appeared at the Tent of Meeting. God said, “Except for Joshua and Caleb, all of the people who are twenty years old or older will wander in the wilderness until they die. They will never enter the Promised Land.”


Ilaah aad ayuu ugu carooday dhamaantood  waxanay ruuxdiisii dul joogtay Tandhaada kulanka. Wuxuna ku yiri, “Laga reebo Yashuuca  iyo Kaaleeb, laakiin dadkiina ka weyn labatan jir  oo dhan waxad ku dhex waalandoontan saxaraha waanad ku dhimaandoontan halkaas. Waaligiina ma geli doontan dhulka aan idinku balan qaaday.”

When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.


Markay dadkii maqleen warkii, aad ayeey uga xumaadeen danbiga aay sameeyn. Hubkoodina intay qaateen ayeey weeraren Kancaan. Muuse ayaa uga digay inay dagaal tagan waayo Ilaah lama jirin iyaga, laakiin way dhegaysan waayeen warku Muuse u ku yidhi iyaga.

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.


Ilaah mala jirin iyaga xaga dagalka ayaa tageen, kadibna dagaalkii waa lagaag roonaday qaar badana waa lagu layeey Israa’iiliyintii. Kadib Israa’iiliyintii waa ka so laabteen dhulkii Kancaan waxanay ku jahwareeren saxara afartan sanno kudahood.

During that time of wandering, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent quail (which is a kind of bird) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During those forty years, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.


Intay ku jireen wakhatiga jahwareerka, Ilaah aad ayuu ugu naxariistay waanu quudinayeey iyaga. Samada ayuu kimis uga so dajinayey loo yaqan “ maana.” Waxa kale oo samada uu uga soo dajinayay shimbiro si aay hilib uga dhigtaan. Intii lagu jiray afartaan ka sanno, Ilaah wuxu ka ilaaliyeey in dharkooda iyo kabahoodu dhamaadan dadk reer Israa’iil.

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. God was still faithful to his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.


Ilaah si mucjiso leh ayuu xatta biyaha dhagax dhexdooda uga so saaray. Laakin waxaas oo dhan dadk reer Israa’iil wali waay cabanayeen oo Ilaah iyo Muusaba way ka so hor jeeden. Laakiin Ilaah wali kamu bixin axdigii u la galay Ibrahim , Isaaq iyo Yacquub.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-14-13.jpg?direct&}}


One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”


Maalin, ayaa dadkii biyo waayeen. Ilaah ayaa Muuse ku yiri, “ La hadal dhagaxa, biyo ayaa ka soo yacii doone.” Laakiin Muuse mu adeecin hadalki Ilaah kadib wuxu dhagaxi ku garacay ul laba jeeri xagii uu kala hadlki laha dhagaxa si biyo uga so yaacan.  Laakiin biyo ayaa ka so burqaday dhagaxi cid kastena way ka cabtay, laakiin Ilaah raali kama noqon arinkii uu Muuse sameeyey ee usha uu la dhacay dhagaxa, waxanu ku yiri, “ Ma geli doontid dhulka aan balan qaaday.”

After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day he would raise up another prophet like Moses.


Kabacadi markay Israa’iiliyintii afartan sanno saxaraha ku wareertay , dhamaan dadkii arinka Ilaah ka so hor jeestay oo dhani way dhinteen.Kadibna Ilaah dadkii wuxu u waday qarka dhulkii uu ugu balan qaday ee Kancaan. Muuse hada wuu gaboobay, kadibna waxa uu magacany inu Yashuuca uu dadka hogaamiyo horkacana. Ilaah wuxu Muuse ugu balan qaaday inu maalin un oo ka dhex dhelin doona dadkiisa Nebi aad ugu dhow Nebi Muuse xagga shaqada.


{{:https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-14-15.jpg?direct&}}


God brought Moses to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but never entered it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.


Ilaah wuxu Muuse dul geeyey buur dusheed si uu  arko dhulka loogu balan qaaday.  Muuse dhulkii loogu balan qaaday dusha ayuu ka arkay laakiin mu kasban inu galo halkaas. Kadibna Muuse wuu dhintay, Israa’iiliyintiina saddex iyo toban cisho ayeey u baroorteen. Yashuuca ayaa noqday hogaamiyahoodii cusub. Yashuuca wuxu noqday hogaamiye fican, waayo wuxu amiinay oo adeecay Ilaahay.
