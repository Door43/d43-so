The religious leaders were grumbling because Jesus was treating these people as friends. So Jesus told this story.


Wadaada diinta aad ayeey uga xumaadeen waayo Ciise waxa uu wax u barayeey cashuur qadayasha iyo kuwa kaleba si saxiibtinimo ku jirta. Kadib Ciise ayaa sheekadan soo socota ugu sheekeyey.

“There was a man who had two sons. The younger son told his father, ‘Father, I want my inheritance now!’ So the father divided his property between the two sons.”


“Nin baa laba wiil lahaa. Kii yaraa ayaa aabbihii ku yidhi, Aabbow, waxaaga qaybtii aan heli lahaa i sii. Markaasuu iyaga u qaybiyey wuxuu ku noolaa.”

“Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and wasted his money in sinful living.”


“Maalmo aan badnayn dabadeed wiilkii yaraa waa wada urursaday wax walbaba, oo dhul fog ayuu u safray, halkaas ayuuna wixiisii ku khasaariyey, isagoo iska tumanayaa.”

“At that time a severe famine came on the land, and the younger son had no money to buy food. So he took the only job he could find, feeding pigs. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”


“Goortuu wada bixiyey dabadeed ayaa abaar daran dhulkaas ka dhacday, wuuna bilaabay inuu baahdo. Goortaasuu tegey oo isku daray nin dadka dhulkaas ah, kan u diray beerihiisa inuu doofaarro daajiyo. Wuxuu damcay inuu calooshiisa ka buuxiyo buunshihii doofaarradu ay cunayeen, ninnana waxba ma uu siin.”

“Finally, the younger son said to himself, ‘What am I doing? All my father’s servants have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his servants.’”


“Goortuu isgartay ayuu yidhi, Intee baa kuwa aabbahay kiraystay haysata kibis ka badan in ku filan, aniguna macaluul baan halkan ugu bakhtiyayaa. 18 Waan kici oo aan aabbahay u tegi, oo waxaan ku odhan, Aabbow, waxaan ku dembaabay jannada iyo hortaadaba.”

“While the younger son was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion for him. He ran to his son and hugged him and kissed him.”


“Markaasuu kacay, oo wuxuu u yimid aabbihii, laakiin intuu weli ka fogaa ayaa aabbihiis arkay, waana u naxariistay, oo ku soo orday oo qoortuu iskaga duubay, oo dhunkaday.”

“The son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am not worthy to be your son.’”


“Markaasaa wiilkii ku yidhi, Aabbow, waxaan ku dembaabay jannada iyo hortaadaba; kol dambe ma istaahilo in laygu yeedho wiilkaaga.”

“But his father told one of his servants, ‘Go quickly! Bring the best clothes and put them on my son! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the best calf so we can have a feast, because my son was dead, but now he is alive! He was lost, but now he is found!’”


“Laakiin aabbihii ayaa addoommadiisii ku yidhi, Dhaqso u soo bixiya khamiiska ugu wanaagsan oo u geliya, kaatunna gacanta u geliya, kabona cagaha u geliya. Dibigii yaraa ee la shishleeyey keena oo gowraca, aynu cunno oo faraxno, waayo, wiilkaygan wuu dhintay, wuuna soo noolaaday; wuu lumay, waana la helay.”

“And the people began to celebrate. Before long, the older son came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and wondered what was happening.”


“Markaasay bilaabeen inay farxaan. 25 Laakiin wiilkiisii weynaa beerta buu ku jiray, oo intuu soo socday oo guriga u soo dhowaanayay, wuxuu maqlay muusika iyo cayaar.”

“When the older son found out that there was a party because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to join the party, but he refused.”


“Laakiin wuu cadhooday, oo inuu galo ma doonayn, markaasaa aabbihiis soo baxay oo baryay”

“The older son said to his father, ‘All these years I’ve worked so faithfully for you! I never disobeyed you, and still you did not even give me one small goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who wasted your money on sinful behavior came home, you killed the best calf for him!’”


“Laakiin wuu u jawaabay, oo wuxuu aabbihiis ku yidhi, Bal eeg, intaas oo sannadood ayaan kuu shaqaynayay, oo weligay amarkaaga kama aan xadgudbin, oo weligaa waxar iima aad siin inaan saaxiibbadayda la farxo. Laakiin goortii uu yimid wiilkaagani waxaagii aad ku noolayd dhillooyin la cunay, waxaad u gowracday dibigii yaraa ee la shishleeyey.”

“The father answered, ‘My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But it is right for us to celebrate, because your brother was dead, but now is alive. He was lost, but now is found!’”


“Markaasuu ku yidhi, Wiilkaygiiyow, weligaa waad ila joogtaa, oo waxayga oo dhan adigaa leh, laakiin waxaa inoo wanaagsanayd inaynu rayrayno oo faraxno, waayo, waalaalkaagani waa dhintay, wuuna soo noolaaday; wuu lumay, waana la helay.”
